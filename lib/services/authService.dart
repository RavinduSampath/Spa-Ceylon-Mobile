// The AuthService is responsible for handling all authentication-related operations in the Spa Ceylon Mobile app.
// This service acts as a bridge between the app's UI and Firebase Authentication (or any other authentication provider).
//
// Key Responsibilities:
// 1. User Authentication: Handles sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out functionality
// 2. Authentication State Management: Monitors and provides the current authentication state
// 3. User Profile Management: Creates and updates user profile information in the database
// 4. Password Management: Handles password reset and update operations
// 5. Social Authentication: Manages authentication through social providers (Google, Facebook, etc.)
// 6. Session Management: Maintains and validates user sessions
//
// The service uses the UserModel class to structure and store user data consistently across the app.
// It also handles error management for authentication operations and provides meaningful feedback
// to the UI layer when authentication operations succeed or fail.
//
// Usage:
// The AuthService is typically injected into screens or controllers that need authentication
// functionality, allowing those components to perform auth operations without knowing the
// implementation details of the authentication provider.
